//Note! this is additional task that requires understanding of HashSet, so please, read the article: HashSet before implementing the task.
//Implement class Student : add the constructor (with field initializations) and necessary methods into it.
//Add public static GetCommonStudents() method to Student class that returns a HashSet of common elements of two student lists.
//For example, for a given list1 [Student [Id=1, Name=Ivan], Student[Id = 2, Name = Petro], Student[Id = 3, Name = Stepan]] and list2[Student[Id = 1, Name = Ivan], Student[Id = 3, Name = Stepan], Student[Id = 4, Name = Andriy]] you should get [Student [Id=3, name=Stepan], Student[Id = 1, Name = Ivan]].
