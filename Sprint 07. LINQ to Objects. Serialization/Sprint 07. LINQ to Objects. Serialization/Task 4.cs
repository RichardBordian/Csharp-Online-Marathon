//Please, create a static method GetWord takes 2 string parameters: 
//         first - initial string with a sequence of words separated by space 
//         second - a word for comparison.
//The method should find the longest word in the first parameter, that is longer than the second parameter if there is one,
//otherwise, the second parameter should be the result of the search.
//The method should return the part of the found word, starting from the first 'a' char. 
//If there isn't 'a' char in the found word, the method should return an empty string.
//(You don't need to verify on null parameter values. Assume that parameters will always be not null)
